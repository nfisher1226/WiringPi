How to install wiringPi
=======================

The easiest way is to use the supplied 'build' script:

  ./build

that should do a complete install or upgrade of wiringPi for you
in the default /usr installation prefix. For more fine grained
control you can use the DESTDIR and PREFIX environment variables.
DESTDIR will do a 'fake' install into some other directory, for
packaging puposes. PREFIX will change the default install from
/usr to some other location ie: /opt or /usr/local.

NOTE: Due to limitations in how the original build system was
written, you will have to first do a 'live' installation of the
libraries so that the headers will be found while building the
device library. This will be fixed in a later revision. <N.F.>

To un-install wiringPi:

  ./build uninstall
